# Timer-MGTC28
This is a modified timer program that is designed for the Nerve of Steel Game 
  
Nerve of Steel is a party game where players sit in a circle.  When the game begins:

1. The program displays "Players stand"

2. The program sleeps for a random time between 5 to 25 seconds.  While the program is sleeping, players can sit down.  Keep track of the last person to sit down.

3. When sleep is over, the program displays "Time Up.  Last to sit down wins." To keep track of the winner, the program asks if the last person is still standing if yes then they have won!
